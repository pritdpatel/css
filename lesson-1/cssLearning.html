        <p class="essay">Summers are full of daylight hours and supposed leisure time, but I find that I’m usually so busy that I have a hard time finding time to read longer books. From casual conversations with friends and colleagues, I suspect I’m not alone in this.

            Admittedly, I’m notoriously incapable of reading short story or essay collections. This is mostly because a huge part of why I read is for the characters, so when I read short stories, I feel like I’m only just beginning to get to know the characters when the story ends. Similarly, with essays, there often aren’t any characters, so I can struggle to find a connection to the writing.
